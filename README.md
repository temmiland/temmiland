## Hi, I'm Temmi! 🙋🏼‍♀️
I’m a Frontend and Fullstack Developer, currently based in Dresden. I build modern, interactive web applications using TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS – always with the goal of turning complex requirements into intuitive, user-friendly interfaces.

I’ve worked on diverse projects across web and mobile using React, React Native, and Angular. I’m also well-versed in tools like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Jira, Confluence, and Notion – whether it's for version control, collaboration, or efficient project management.

I take a structured, solution-oriented approach to development and hold myself to high standards – whether I’m working in a team or independently as a freelancer.

Away from the screen, you’ll find me longboarding, hiking, digging in the garden, caring for plants, or deep in political discussions. My passion for storytelling and worldbuilding often finds its way into my work – I love exploring new ideas and blending technology with creativity.

I believe great software is born where curiosity, empathy, and technology meet.

Let’s build something that doesn’t just work – but inspires. 🚀
